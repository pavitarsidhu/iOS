This is a restaurant meal delivery application for the iPhone. I'm officially releasing 
it now as an open source project. If you intend to use this software, substantial 
changes to the source code will have to be made because it's currently using API calls
to specific URLs. There are more than likely a few bugs present as well because the software
was designed a year ago and has largely been unmaintained. 

If you would like to use it, but need any kind of assistance, please don't hesitate to  
contact me at my provided email below. I will guide you through in how to setup this 
application for your own custom use. I can give you insight as to what response it expects 
from URL requests for restaurant names, menues, prices, etc.

The backend database used was MongoDB, and all data is passed using JSON.
